## Introduction

**nf-core/phyloplace** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline that performs phylogenetic placement with EPA-NG.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner.
It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.
The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies.
Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure.
This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources.The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/phyloplace/results).

## Pipeline summary

1. Optionally: Search a fasta file with a set of [`HMMER`](http://hmmer.org/) profiles. Best hits for each profile will be passed to the steps below.
2. Align query sequences to the reference alignment using either [`HMMER`](http://hmmer.org/), [`clustalo`](http://www.clustal.org/omega/) or [`MAFFT`](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/).
3. Place query sequences in reference phylogeny with [`EPA-NG`](https://github.com/Pbdas/epa-ng).
4. Graft query sequences onto the reference phylogeny with [`GAPPA`](https://github.com/lczech/gappa).
5. If provided with a classification of the reference sequences, classify query sequences with [`GAPPA`](https://github.com/lczech/gappa).

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow.Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/phyloplace \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --phyloplace_input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

Or:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/phyloplace \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --phylosearch_input search_params.csv \
   --search_fasta sequences.faa \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/phyloplace/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/phyloplace/parameters).

## Pipeline output

To see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/phyloplace/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.
